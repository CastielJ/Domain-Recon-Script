#Domain Recon script

You can see more info in README2.md

Also, you can ignore the zip file in here. It has the script and readme2 in it

So, I finished my first ever shell script, and I want to make it public. It just recons the Domain and gives you some info:

Subdomains – Lists all discovered subdomains.

WHOIS Info – Registration details for the domain.

DNS Info – DNS records for the domain.

SSL/TLS Info – SSL certificates and potential vulnerabilities.

IP Address – The domain's associated IP address and reverse DNS info.

Tech Stack – Identifies technologies used on the website.

Directory Discovery – Directories on the site.

Vulnerability Scan – Scans for security issues on the live subdomains.

Archived URLs – Shows archived versions of the site.

Vulnerability Identification – Looks for common security issues like XSS, RCE, and LFI.

Port Scan – Shows open ports and services on the domain's IP.
